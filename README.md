# bitburner-scripts
This is a collection of scripts for the browser/Steam game BitBurner. For the unknowing, this isn't actually hacking.
I'd hope it's obvious, considering the way you get money is literally by typing "hack", but the amount of people who
don't realize that is concerning. Additionally, scripts are literally a *part* of the game, so please don't come at
me for "cheating".
